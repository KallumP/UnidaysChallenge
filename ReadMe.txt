The source code is placed in the "source" folder.
This program was coded in C#, so the source code will have to be opened in visual studio.
To compile the app use .NET Framework 4.6.1 in Visual Studio 2017 (that is what i coded it in)


To run the exe (without having to compile) navigate to the "exes" folder, and double click the UnidaysChallenge.exe file.
The program has instructions written at the top of the window for help.


My working out and diagrams are located in the "workings" folder. 
The class diagram can be opened in a program called "draw.io" or look at the image.
