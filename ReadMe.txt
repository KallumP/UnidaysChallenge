The source code is placed in the "source" folder.
This program was coded in C#, so the source code will have to be opened in visual studio.
To compile the app, use .NET Framework 4.6.1 in Visual Studio 2017 (that is how I coded it).


To run the .exe (without having to compile) navigate to the "exes" folder and double click the UnidaysChallenge.exe file.
The program has instructions written at the top of the window for help.


My working out and diagrams are located in the "documentation" folder. 
The diagrams can be opened in a free program called "draw.io" or open the .png images.
